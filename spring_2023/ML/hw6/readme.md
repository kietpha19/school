KMeans
- can try different value of k by changing the value line 82 (KMeans.py)
- run the program by the command: python KMeans.py
- the program will run and generate images one by one (round 0, round 1, and the finnal round)
- close the image to keep the program running

EM
- can try different value of k by changing the value line 100 (EM.py)
- run the program by the command: python EM.py
- the program will run and generate images one by one (round 0, round 1, and the finnal round)
- close the image to keep the program running
- notice that the EM stopped after the first round, so there are only 2 image for value of k = 2, 3, and 4. May have more rounds for bigger k
